# Scratch-First-Week-CS50
This is my work for the first week or lecture of the CS50 program.
There's the link associated to the file.

The code could be improved, but this is my first work in Scratch. I guess it's competent to be my debut.
Reset it two times because the variables don't get booted that correctly the first time, but at the second time it works fine.
